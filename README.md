# FL-base-7-converter
Converts numbers in FL into base (7). Do not confuse with base 7

1000=777+2*77+9*7+6

It also marks out 7s (Which doesn't actually always works correctly for now)


Instructions: Use any usersctipt manager  e.g Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey. Tested on Tampermonkey, should work in others. 
If you don't know what to do with it nor how to google it you probably shouldn't use scripts you found on internet anyway. (//aka, I am to lazy to write proper instructions now)
